Ubiqlog is a energy-efficient open source tool for "life logging", based on Android platform. It creates a JSON file per day that contains all activities within the device. It is flexible mobile sensing tool, enable users configure its sensors and add/remove new sensors to it.

-	Recent version measures physical activity and location based on Google Play service. However in the source you can change it to the core version, if you are not willing to use Google Play Services. 
-	Visualizations are disabled in this version, because there is work ongoing to make something really different.

Special thanks to Martin Tomitsch for the UI design and Victor Andrei Gugonatu for his development effort to make this project run.
